# Question 2
2. Based on the small number of connected devices and requests to sites like Facebook, PNC and Google, we think that this is likely a personal home network.
# Question 3
3a. XS4ALL
3b. Active, the PORT request is coming from the User to the Server.
3c. One major vulnerability is that the username and password is readily visible to an attacker.
3d. We could use SFTP (SSH file transfer protocol), this protocol encrypts data transferred to/from the FTP server or SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) also encrypts data in transit when tranferring files between a local computer and another host on the network.
# Question 4
4a. www.pnc.com
4b. No, there isn't a way for HTTPS to protect against the attacker being able to determine the domain name.  There are a few reasons for this, first is that the TCP connection needs to be established, which may reveal the domain name.  In addition, we likely did an unecrypted DNS look-up before hand to access the site which the attacker may be able to see.

4d. Yes, there are some with security concerns.  One of the cipher suites uses MD5 which has known collisions and therefore is not secure.  Some of the cipher suites use RC4 which is a stream cipher that has some vulnerabilities as well.
